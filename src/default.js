Eta Carinae, in the Keyhole Nebula, is the only star currently thought to emit natural LASER light.

His name is also given to these two large and remarkable craters on the Moon. Standouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8 and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively. Their elongated shapes are explained by an extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by the impactor, moving left to right, that gouged out the craters. The shallow impact also resulted in two bright rays of material extending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture. Intended to be viewed with red/blue glasses (red for the left eye), this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created from high resolution scans of two images (AS11-42-6304, AS11-42-6305) taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091211.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0912/MessierCrater3d_vantuyne.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Messier Craters in Stereo', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0912/MessierCrater3d_vantuyneC900.jpg'}, {'concepts': 'concept_tags functionality turned off in current service', 'date': '2016-10-09', 'explanation': 'Ninety percent of the houses on Grenada were damaged by the destructive force of Hurricane Ivan.

This moon was a full moon, specifically\xa0called a Flower Moon at this time of the year.  But that didn't make it strange -- full moons occur once a month (moon-th).  This moon was a supermoon, meaning that it reached its full phase near its closest approach\xa0to the Earth in its slightly elliptical orbit.  Somewhat strange, a supermoon appears a bit larger and brighter than the average full moon -- and enables it to be called a Super Flower Moon.\xa0 This moon was undergoing a total lunar eclipse. An eclipsed moon can look quite strange, being dark, unevenly lit, and, frequently, red -- sometimes called blood red. Therefore, this moon could be called a Super Flower Blood Moon. This moon was seen through thin clouds. These clouds created a faint corona around the moon, making it look not only strange, but colorful.  This moon was imaged so deeply that the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, far in the background, was visible to its lower right.  This moon, this shadow, this galaxy and these colors were all captured last month near Cassilis, NSW, Australia -- with a single shot.

This stunning view of the cluster combines recent telescopic images of the cluster's dense core with digitized photographic plates recorded between 1987 and 1991 using the Samuel Oschin Telescope, a wide-field survey instrument at Palomar Observatory.
